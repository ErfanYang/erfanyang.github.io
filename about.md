## Personal Statement
Detail-orientated and enthusiastic undergraduate with recent experience in optics and cold atoms labs. Considerable multi-disciplinary experience across cold atoms, nonlinear optics, basic electrical engineering, and Artificial Intelligence. Capable of conducting effective independent research by designing fundamental experiments from scratch, coupled with organized knowledge management and progress record. Keen to further expand my portfolio
in the field of quantum optics, especially in cold atoms through doctorate-level research opportunities.

## Experience
**Research Apprentice** Xi’an Jiaotong University, Advisor: Prof. Hong Gao <span style="float:right">Sept 2023-Present</span>
- Assisted in producing cold Rb atoms in the magneto-optical trap by four-wave mixing and exploring new methods of quantum memory

**Research Apprentice** UC Berkeley, Advisor: Prof. Eric Y. Ma <span style="float:right">Oct 2022-June 2023</span>
- Looked into nonlinear optical effects in phthalocyanine thin films theoretically and experimentally and learned how to design and complete an experiment from nothing independently

**Team Member**  <span style="float:right">Fall 2021</span>
- Assisted in the realization of low melting point metal near the melting point of the thermal conductivity measurement device

**Team Leader** <span style="float:right">July 2022</span>
- Led a team in a competition focused on an underwater imaging system based on polarization fusion and the Yolo algorithm


## Skills
**Experimental:**
- Familiar with operating optical components, constructing optical paths, and using related instruments.

**Computational:**
- Familiar with Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and basic machine learning. Experienced with PyVISA and completed a final project about evaluating the signal significance and measuring the signal strength of a given process

**Communication:**
- Confidence and effective communication skills developed through:
	- regular meetings with mentors and writing progress monitoring notes and summary documents
	- presentations on final projects of some courses during my degree to audiences of up to 100 people

**Team Collaboration:**
- Worked in groups during my degree and volunteering. Comfortable with adapting to the needs of various team sizes. Demonstrated collaborative generating new ideas and problem-solving.
