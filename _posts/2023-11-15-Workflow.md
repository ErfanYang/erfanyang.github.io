## Intruduction
I will first explain my personal workflow first and then introduce tools I use.
### 🤔My workflow
1. After waking up, open Obsidian and create today's daily note by the plugin "QuickAdd". My note usually contain today's weather, the wake-up and sleep time, a to-do list, 3 happy things I experienced today and what I thought today.
2. Start with the most urgent task. Sometimes I try to do the most easy or difficult mission first if there is nothing urgent. Beginning with a esay quest may give me much sense of achievement and thereby motivating me to continue to the next. On the other hand, I always find it easier to think about a difficult mission or anything that I don't want to do at all.
3. Research
4. Study

title: little suggestion for a fun daily note
For the to-do list, use the mission system in the game that you love🤩 Here is mine:
Mainline quests🌟
- [ ] read the review on my senior thesis

Side quests✨
- [ ] send cards for postcrossing

Daily missions💡
- [ ] finish my daily note
- [ ] read 30 pages of any literature books
- [ ] take a photo...

And give yourself some bonus if you have done all of them (like a cup of milktea🤩)
