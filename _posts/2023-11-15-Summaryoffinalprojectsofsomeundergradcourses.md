## Photoelectron & Intro to EE
### Install Arduino IDE
I was using Arduino UNO R3. Arduino reminds me of installing avr boards which contains UNO boards but I kept failing to install it.
Arduino will automatically install avr-gcc@7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7 package and so on to setup the avr boards. **Just wait** for minutes even hours!
If an error "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process." occurs, that may because you click the Install button on the left side in the board manager panel, while Arduino is downloading it at the same time.
And don't change the Internet environment (like activating a vpn). Otherwise Arduino will stop downloading and told you unfortunately it failsðŸ˜¢
